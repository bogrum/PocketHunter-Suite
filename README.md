## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.8+
  - A running Redis server
  - PocketHunter CLI tools
  - SMINA docking software (for molecular docking)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:bogrum/PocketHunter-Suite.git
    cd streamlit_pockethunter_app
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Install docking dependencies (optional):**
    ```bash
    ./install_docking_deps.sh
    ```
4.  **Start your Redis server:**
    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```
5.  **Start the Celery worker:**
    ```bash
    celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
    ```
6.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

## üìã Modular Workflow Guide

The application guides you through a four-step scientific pipeline. Each step can be executed independently using a previous step's Job ID or by uploading new files.

1.  **Extract Frames:** Convert molecular dynamics trajectories (`.xtc`) to individual PDB files.
2.  **Detect Pockets:** Identify potential binding sites using the PDB files.
3.  **Cluster Pockets:** Group similar pockets to find representative binding sites.
4.  **Molecular Docking:** Dock ligands to the cluster representatives to analyze binding affinities.

A dedicated **Task Monitor** allows you to view the status, filter, and manage all of your jobs in one place.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built on a scalable and robust architecture.

  * **Frontend:** The user interface is built with **Streamlit**, enhanced with custom CSS for a modern look. It uses **Plotly** for rich, interactive data visualizations.
  * **Backend:** Heavy computational tasks are handled asynchronously by **Celery**. **Redis** serves as the message broker, facilitating communication and real-time updates between the frontend and the backend.
  * **Data Flow:** Files are uploaded to an organized directory structure. Celery workers process these files, and results are stored in a dedicated `results/` directory, ready for download.

## üéØ Molecular Docking

The molecular docking feature is a core component of the pipeline. It is integrated using **SMINA**, a fast and accurate docking tool.

### Docking Parameters

You can configure key docking parameters directly from the sidebar:

  - **Number of Poses:** Controls the number of possible binding poses (1-50).
  - **Exhaustiveness:** Determines the accuracy and computational cost of the docking run (1-20, higher is more accurate).
  - **pH:** Specifies the protonation state of the molecules (4.0-10.0, default 7.4).

## üêõ Troubleshooting

  * **Redis Connection:** Ensure your Redis server is actively running before starting the Celery worker and the Streamlit app.
  * **Celery Workers:** Check the worker's terminal logs for any errors if a task is not running correctly.
  * **File Permissions:** Verify that the `uploads` and `results` directories have the correct read/write permissions.
